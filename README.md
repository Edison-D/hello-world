# hello-world
I will be working on random Web Development and Computer Programming projects of my own.

Hi, I'm Edison. I'm a hobbiest and, in my opinion, I am very expierenced in JavaScript. If anyone would like to collaborate on a project idea involving HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, I would happily do so.
